# Airbnb Market Analysis â€“ Seattle

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Seattle's Airbnb market using data visualizations created in Tableau. The analysis explores key metrics, trends, and insights into pricing, occupancy rates, property distribution, and more, helping to understand the dynamics of Airbnb listings across Seattle.

## Project Overview
